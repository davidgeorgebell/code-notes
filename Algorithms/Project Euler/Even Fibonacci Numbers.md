# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed n, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

```javascript
function fiboEvenSum(n) {
  let a = 1
  let b = 2
  let c = 0
  let sum = 2

  while(c < n) {
    c = a + b
    a = b 
    b = c

    if(c % 2 === 0) {
      sum = sum + c
    }
  }

  return sum;
}
```
